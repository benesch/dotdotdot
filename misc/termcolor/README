The XML files in this directory are fragments of property list ("plist")
documents that represent macOS Terminal.app color schemes. They were extracted
from a property list file for a Terminal.app that had been configured through
the GUI on macOS Mojave using a command like the following

    $ plutil -extract "Window Settings.Solarized-VARIANT" xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist

and then modified to remove the XML header, leaving just the naked <dict>
element.

See the dotdotdot installation script for an example of how to install these
plists automatically.
